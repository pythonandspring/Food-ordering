# Restaurant Ordering and Delivery Platform

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to streamline the interaction between customers and restaurants, improving the online food ordering experience. The platform will enable customers to search for restaurants, browse menus, place orders, and track their deliveries in real-time. For restaurants, it will provide a system to manage orders, assign delivery personnel, and offer live updates on order status. The platform will also integrate delivery management features, including real-time tracking and geolocation data capture. 

**Key Features:**
- **Customer:** Search for restaurants, browse menus, place orders, track deliveries.
- **Restaurant:** Manage orders, assign deliveries, update order statuses.
- **Delivery Management:** Capture geolocation data, display real-time tracking on maps.

**Technologies:**
- Modern web technologies and frameworks, such as React.js, Django, and Docker.
