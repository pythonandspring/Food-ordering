# Food Ordering System

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to streamline the interaction between customers and restaurants, improving the online food ordering experience. The platform will enable customers to search for restaurants, browse menus, place orders, and track their deliveries in real-time. For restaurants, it will provide a system to manage orders, assign delivery personnel, and offer live updates on order status. The platform will also integrate delivery management features, including real-time tracking and geolocation data capture, as well as email notifications for user registration, login, and order updates.

### Key Features:
- **Customer**: Search for restaurants, browse menus, place orders, track deliveries, and receive email notifications.
- **Restaurant**: Manage orders, assign deliveries, update order statuses.
- **Delivery Management**: Capture geolocation data, display real-time tracking on maps.

### Technologies:
- Web development with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**.
- **Django** for backend development and API integration.
- **SQLite** for development database.
- **Docker** for containerization.
- **Email Notifications** using **Django Email** for order confirmation, user registration, and login.
